The idea for designing the footer icons was inspired by the Love Running project, as it enhances the footer's visual appeal.

The div class container in the footer was taken from Bootstrap https://getbootstrap.com/
The main section div id about the code was taken from https://getbootstrap.com/

The text in the <div class="container"> in the footer was my inspiration, but ChatGPT has corrected the grammar for me.
The text in the main section <div id="about"> was my inspiration, but ChatGPT has corrected the grammar for me.
The form code in about.html was taken by bootstrap https://getbootstrap.com/
The idea for the form in about.html and its modifications was inspired by the Code Institute challenge called Portfolio. I modified it slightly with ChatGPT to add a required section I also added another line to the form based on my own idea to ensure it aligns with what I want to display on my website. Additionally, I thought it would be nice for the user to receive a congratulations page upon submitting the form. In one of the lessons at Code Institute, I learned that if I pass the link template with POST, I would achieve that result. I incorporated this into Bootstrap so the form retains its styling while also directing the user to the congratulations page.
