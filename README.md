## INTRODUCTION

This website is my first project with Code Institute as part of my Full Stack Development Course.

Jessy's Journal is a web application designed to offer users a chance to win a free trip to one of my top four travel destinations. As someone passionate about traveling, I understand that not everyone has the opportunity to explore the world the way I have.

Through this website, users can browse my top travel destinations and participate in a giveaway for a free trip by following me on social media. This not only helps grow my social media presence but also allows me to give an incredible 7 day trip experience to a lucky winner.

### Navigation bar:
The navigation bar is a persistent feature on every page and is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal user experience across all devices and screen resolutions. On mobile devices, it automatically transitions into a hamburger menu, allowing easy access to all pages and sections. This intuitive design ensures seamless navigation, regardless of the user's device or screen size

### Footer:

The footer is a persistent element on every page, designed to be fully responsive and adaptable to all devices and screen resolutions. It includes a dedicated section for social media icons, which open in a new tab when clicked, allowing users to access my Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook without interrupting their browsing experience.

![alt text](docs/image-16.png)

### Hero image:
The hero image in Jessy's Journeys is strategically placed on the homepage to immediately capture the user's attention and convey the website's purpose. To ensure an optimal user experience, the hero section is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices. Additionally, the hero section features contains text that dynamically adjusts and repositions itself based on different screen sizes. It scales down on smaller devices like phones and I have made to change possitions on Ipad while maintaining a good placement on larger screens. This ensures that the text does not obstruct the background image, providing a visually appealing and readable design across all devices.

**Hero on large screens:**

**Hero on ipad screens:**

I intentionally positioned the text slightly lower on the iPad view to prevent the navigation bar from looking too cluttered. This placement ensures a clean and balanced layout, with the navigation bar at the top and the text positioned lower for better readability. At the same time, it maintains the integrity of the background image of Angkor Wat, ensuring it remains visually appealing.

**Links**

All links on the homepage are correctly linked to the appropriate About and Travel pages.

### Bugs and Fixes:

There was an issue with the Bootstrap cards not displaying correctly. Even though the images were set to fit the content, they were not working as expected.

I initially tried fixing the issue using media queries, but the problem persisted. Eventually, I realized that a media query wasn't necessary—I simply needed to set .card-body { min-height: 200px; }. This adjustment ensured that all cards displayed uniformly across all devices.

The bug was successfully fixed.

# Credit:

#### I would also like to mention that most of the code comes from Code Institute projects that I have worked on, such as Love Running and my portfolio project. These projects were a huge source of inspiration for me, so I incorporated parts of them while combining Bootstrap code with my own content. However, the overall idea for the website was entirely mine, and my partner contributed some small ideas along the way.

#### Additionally, I have made many changes throughout the development process, carefully committing and pushing them all to GitHub. The reason for these changes was the valuable feedback I received from my partner, which helped me refine the website and achieve a clear and user-friendly design.


* Fonts - https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lato:wght@300&family=Oswald:wght@200;300;400;500;600;700&display=swap
* Favicons - taken from https://realfavicongenerator.net/
* Social media icons are taken from font awesome - https://fontawesome.com/kits/bede36f393/download
* The idea for designing the footer icons was inspired by the Love Running project, as it enhances the footer's visual appeal.
* The Hero URL in style.css was taken in Cambodia by me while traveling.
* The image on the index.html and travel.html site were taken by me and my partner while travelling.
* The text in the div class="container" in the footer was my inspiration, but ChatGPT has corrected the grammar for me. 
* The text in all my site's pages index.html, about.html, and travel.html was inspired by my travels. However, ChatGPT helped correct the grammar and refine the wording.
* The bootstrap section in index.html and travel.html site was created using Bootstrap, combined with elements from a Code Institute project and my own content. https://getbootstrap.com/
* The idea for the form in about.html and its modifications was inspired by the Code Institute challenge called Portfolio. I modified it slightly with ChatGPT to add a "required" section. Additionally, I thought it would be nice for the user to receive a congratulations page upon submitting the form. In one of the lessons at Code Institute, I learned that if I past the link template with POST. I incorporated this into Bootstrap so the form retains its styling while also directing the user to the congratulations page.
* The image of Uluru in Australia in the trave.html site was taken from https://www.pexels.com/search/uluru/
* Am I responsive -  https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://xhesjana1.github.io/Jessy-s-Journeys/
* On the about.html site colors are taken from the colorspace website so they batch perfectly https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23C3A4BA&sub=1
* The rest of the colors on this project were chosen by me, with some inspired by the Love Running project. I liked the look of them at the time, so I decided to reuse them for this project.

##### Please note that all text in this project has been corrected by ChatGPT to ensure the grammar is displayed correctly.
